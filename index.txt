I am new student of spring 2019 batch who opted to do masters in Applied Computer Science.
I am from Warangal, India. I hold a bachelor’s degree in mechanical engineering from Veltech University, Chennai.
So things are pretty new for me right now, but I believe I’ll be with good knowledge on Computer Science by the time of my graduation. 
My short term goal is to see myself in a challenging role in the IT Sector, whereas my ultimate goal is to become a cinematographer, which takes time.
My interests include going for long drives, photography obviously.
